                     "summary" : "As I scramble for answers, I heard a still voice saying although the earthly doctors do not know of the cure or the cause, us air force your heavenly doctor does and He is going to heal you.This gave me hope and I was determined to snatch and hold on to that promise. As I cooperated with the doctors’ orders to do aqua exercises and make routine visits to the pain management specialist. In addition I went to a Chiropractor and kept searching for natural remedies. I began to see small changes.As I prayed and seek God’s complete healing, I would discover new things daily that would aid in my healing. This is the reason I call this section freedom because I want you to know that if God sets me free from a debilitating condition He will do the same for you. Freedom knows that God gives power to those who are tired and worn out as it is written:He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak (Isaiah 40:29).My daily life is focused on keeping this temple (my body) in the best condition. This means having an exercise schedule, eating the right things, limiting sweets, dairy products, foods containing yeast, alcoholic beverages and those containing caffeine processed foods and anything that I know does not agree with my body when I eat it. I m not going to say this is easy, but what I will say is that it is worth it, because of these verses:“And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding uk air force seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so (Genesis 1-28-30).When I received the diagnosis which for the ordinary person would have most likely caused panic, I felt relief because I had been suffering for a long time without having any idea of what was going on. All I knew was that something was wrong.I was now able to read up on this condition and learn how to live with it or get rid of it. I found information on the Internet, at the library and from other people who had this condition. Having a Home-based business gives me the freedom I need to listen to books on tapes, while I work, therefore increasing my knowledge bank.It was comforting to learn that I was not alone. In fact, reports indicate that there are approximately 800,000 thousand people nationwide suffering from this condition. One article that I read stated that Fibromyalgia is mainly caused from low serotonin level and another symptom is that it affects the immune system.My immune system was already compromised due to lack of sleep, but it did not take long before my sleep pattern changed and my hours of sleep increased from three to six hours and more. This vicious cycle had now taken a turn and I was feeling like myself again. I was feeling relief from agonizing pain and fatigue I had suffered year after year.My rest had become so peaceful and extended that I did not want to get out of bed in the mornings, not because of pain anymore, but because of the comfort.No longer was I experiencing pain throughout the day, affecting everything I did, including, my performance at work. I also found out more about what was happening to my body and how to deal with fibromyalgia. That was a liberating feeling. The best part about all this is that I have found that having a Home-based Business is the perfect business for me.If you are struggling with this condition, do not give in to those feelings. I know your body just wants to lie in bed, but you have to use your mind and will power to combat those feelings of hopelessness. If you allow your feelings and thoughts of hopelessness to control your mind, you could ruin your life forever.I found freedom when air jordan shoes I found out what was going on with me and I decided that I was not going to settle for what the doctor told me or with the way I was feeling most of the time. I learned that my health and well being are my responsibility not my doctors’.I called on God for all the help that I needed, held on to faith and stood planted in the promises of God, that He would heal me. This has proven to be the answer for me. He gave me back the strength in my hands that I am today able to communicate to the world through the power of positive words and actions. He even took me to the Word and showed me that great men and women of God had suffered and that their sufferings were for a reason and that I was no different in my suffering than those people. He took me to the story of Jacob, Joseph, the woman with the issue of blood, Job, the blind man, the deaf man, the man with dumbness, the man with paralysis and many others who were afflicted whether physically or mentally and He said to me, “Do you see what I did for these people?”Then He tells me that above all things, His wish is for me to prosper and be in health.
